# Welcome to the Course!

The objective of the course is "How to make publishable netCDF data".

NetCDF is the most widely used data format for scientific data in the earth system science (ESS). This course targets at scientists who want to share their research data with the scientific community, and tries to help them to create publishable netCDF data. However, the book content can also be of interest to anyone who work with netCDF data or are interested in learning about metadata standards of the ESS community.

In this course we will learn:

1. [What is netCDF?](netcdf_101.ipynb)
2. [What is the CF Conventions?](cf_101.ipynb)
3. [How to generate a grid netCDF file conforming to the CF Conventions?](cf_grid.ipynb)
4. [How to generate a DSG netCDF file conforming to the CF Conventions?](cf_dsg.ipynb)
