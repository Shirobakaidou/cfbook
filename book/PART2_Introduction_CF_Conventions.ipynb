    "## Why should we adopt a metadata standard?\n",
    "\n",
    "In the earth system science (ESS) community, huge amount of data are generated, exchanged, and consumed. It is often a time consuming task for researchers to discover from an enormous pool of data the right dataset they want. Meanwhile, it is also challenging for data providers to bring their data products to users. To meet this challenge in today's research ecosystem, it is a highly recommended practice to enrich and standardize metadata of research datasets. By doing this, you're making your data more findable, interoperable, and reusable by other stakeholders in the community, thus contributing to the achievement of the FAIR principle of open science in a broader sense.\n",
    "\n",
    "A **metadata standard**, by definition, is a set of rules or guidelines that defines how metadata should be structured, described, and managed. It specifies the elements or attributes to be included, the semantics of those elements, and often the syntax or format in which the metadata should be encoded. \n",
    "\n",
    "The CF Conventions is becoming a widely adopted metadata standard for netCDF data format. It is the successor of the COARDS Conventions, and is characterised by its flexibility and campatibility with other metadata standards. Broadly speaking, the CF Conventions does two important things:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Providing standards for attributes: What kind of attributes should be included in netCDFs?\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Giving recommendations on data structure in netCDF for different types of data (e.g. grid data, discret points etc.)\n",

    "According to the [CF Conventions](https://cfconventions.org/Data/cf-conventions/cf-conventions-1.11/cf-conventions.html)(by the time of making this chapter, the most recent version of the CF Conventions is 1.11), some attributes are required while the others are optional. However, it is certainly recommended to enrich the attributes of each variable, as well as the entire dataset, as good as possible. Here, we will use the same [dataset](https://www.unidata.ucar.edu/software/netcdf/examples/tos_O1_2001-2002.nc) of sea surface temperature as an example like in the previous chapter."

    "\n",
    "    * `long_name`/`standard_name`: Define the meaning of the variable. The `long_name` can be given by dataset creators, whereas the `standard_name` must be a controlled vocabulary as defined in the [\"CF Standard Name Table\"](https://cfconventions.org/Data/cf-standard-names/current/build/cf-standard-name-table.html).\n",
    "        * E.g. in variable `tos`, the long name was defined as \"Sea Surface Temperature`, while another formation of the name is allowed too, as long as it makes sense, such as \"sea surface temperature\" or \"Temperature of Sea Surface\". However, the standard name must be strictly written as \"sea_surface_temperature\" just like given in the standard name table.\n",
    "        * Based on the Standard Name Table, the standard name for a longitude variable is always \"longitude\", for a latitude variable is \"latitude\", and for a time variable is \"time\".\n",
    "\n",
    "    * `units`: The unit of the variable, should be parsable by the [UDUNITS library](https://www.unidata.ucar.edu/software/udunits/). If a variable has a `standard_name`, its `units` can be looked up in the \"CF Standard Name Table\" too.\n",
    "        * E.g. As defined in the Standard Name Table, `degrees_north` is the unit for a latitude variable, and `degrees_east` for a longitude variable.\n",
    "        * The `units` of a time variable is supposed to be a string in the form of `[time-interval] since YYYY-MM-DD hh:mm:ss`, e.g. `seconds since 2001-1-1` in the example. \"seconds\", \"minutes\", \"hours\", and \"days\" are the most commonly used time intervals; \"months\" or \"years\" are not recommended because the interval length may vary.\n",
    "        * The `units` of sea surface temperature in the example is given in Kelvin (K), which is aligned with the recommendation by the [\"CF Standard Name Table\"](https://cfconventions.org/Data/cf-standard-names/current/build/cf-standard-name-table.html).\n",

    "    * `_FillValue`: Indicating missing data. It should be scalar (only one value) and outside of the `valid_range`. *This attribute is not allowed for coordinate variables*.\n",

    "### 2. File Structure Recommendations for Diverse Data Types\n",
    "\n",
    "Data in a netCDF file can be presented in two major forms, gridded or as discrete geometry samples (DSGs). Though the interpretation of gridded data may vary depending on its coordinate system, the ways how gridded data are arranged in netCDF files are quite similar. The example that we presented above has a representative structure of gridded data, where multiple layers of grids representing different variables (coordinate variable, auxiliary coordinate variable, data variable) are overlaid upon each other, thus overlaid cells share same coordinates. Data like images captured by earth observation satellites, climate model outputs are usually gridded data. However, the arrangement of DSG data in netCDFs can be very diverse, depending on the type as well as the length of DSG features.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the CF Conventions, DSG features are divided into the following types:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Point**: Unconnected points / stations, each point / station only contains a single element (e.g. Earthquake data, Lightning data).\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Time Series**: Data are taken over periods of time for a single station (e.g. Weather station data, Fixed buoys).\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Profile**: Data are taken along a vertical line at a single station (e.g. Atmospheric profiles from satellites).\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Trajectory**: Data are taken along a spatial path at different times, each trajectory contains a set of connected points (e.g. Cruise data, drifting buoys).\n",
    "\n",
    "* Combined DSG:\n",
    "    * **Timeseries of Profiles**: Profiles taken over periods of time for a fixed station.\n",
    "    * **Trajectory of Profiles**: A collection of profiles along a trajectory (e.g. Ship soundings).\n",
    "\n",
    "The [Appendix H](https://cfconventions.org/Data/cf-conventions/cf-conventions-1.11/cf-conventions.html#appendix-examples-discrete-geometries) of the CF Conventions provides concrete recommendations on the data arrangement of various DSG data. By following the roadmap shown below, you could find the recommended netCDF file structure for the specific type of DSG data you have. In [chapter OOO](), we will walk you through the procedure of creating a netCDF file for various types of time series data as suggested by the CF Conventions; and in [chapter XXX](), we have some exercises prepared so that you can practice creating a standard netCDF file for other types of DSG data (e.g. profile, trajectory, etc.)"
