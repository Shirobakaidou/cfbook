    "# What is netCDF?\n",
    "\n",
    "netCDF stands for Network Common Data Form. It is a data format widely used for creating, accessing, and sharing array-oriented scientific data. In earth system science (ESS), datasets are predominantly published in this format for several reasons:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Self-describing**: A netCDF file includes both the data and metadata, which is information about the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Portable and sharable**: A netCDF file can be accessed by various types of computers and can be read and written simultaneously.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Scalable and appendable**: Data subsets can be easily extracted from netCDF files. Additional data can also be appended to an existing file, as long as the structure of both datasets is aligned.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Suitable for data archiving**: Older versions of netCDF data are as well supported as current and future versions by most softwares.\n",
    "\n",
    "Despite its widespread use, interpreting a netCDF file can be challenging, especially for newcomers to the format. This chapter will help you to easily understand the content structure of a standard netCDF file."

    "## NetCDF Content Structure\n",
    "\n",
    "A netCDF file generally contains **data** and attributes about the data, known as **metadata**. The data is composed of *dimensions* and *variables*, which include coordinate variables, data variables, and sometimes other types of variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "* *Dimensions* define the dimensional span and the shape of the data arrays.\n",
    "\n",
    "* *Coordinate variables* specify the coordinates along each dimension.\n",
    "    \n",
    "* *Data variables* usually represent physical variables in the earth system science (ESS) domain, such as air temperature, wind speed, etc. These variables typically span multiple dimensions, usually over longitude, latitude, time, and vertical dimensions like altitude, depth, and pressure levels.\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition to the data, a standardized netCDF file includes two types of metadata:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. *Variable attributes*: These provide information about individual coordinate and data variables.\n",
    "    \n",
    "2. *Global attributes*: These provide information about the entire dataset."

    "To make the structure of a netCDF file easier to understand, let's examine an [example dataset](https://downloads.psl.noaa.gov/Datasets/ncep.reanalysis/Dailies/surface_gauss/) from the NCEP-NCAR reanalysis. This dataset contains the daily mean air temperature at 2 meters above the Earth's surface for the year 1948. *Please note that `tos:cell_methods = time: mean (interval: 30 minutes)` is considered a mistake of the source dataset, `30 days` instead of `30 minutes` would be correct in its context.*"

    "If a variable contains coordinate information but doesn't fulfill the conditions to be a coordinate variable (not one-dimensional, or not strictly increasing or decreasing, or missing values contained), it is considered an **auxiliary coordinate variable**. In the example above, `time_bnds(time, bnds)` is an auxiliary coordinate variable and, at the same time, a so-called *boundary variable*. It is a two-dimensional array and contains coordinates in pairs that describe the bounds of a time interval. It is a common pratice for many data publishers to select the midpoint of a time interval as time coordinate and define the start and the end of the intervals with a time boundary variable. In the example above, the \"15th day\" of a \"30-day interval\" are selected as time coordinates and time boundaries respectively. This practice is also common for variables of longitude and latitude. Similar to `time_bnds(time, bnds)`, `lon_bnds(lon, bnds)` and `lat_bnds(lat, bnds)` in the example are also auxiliary coordinate variables and the boundary variables for `lon` and `lat`."
