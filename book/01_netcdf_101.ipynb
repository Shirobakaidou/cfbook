    "# What is netCDF?\n",
    "\n",
    "netCDF stands for Network Common Data Form. It is a data format widely used for creating, accessing, and sharing array-oriented scientific data. In earth system science (ESS), datasets are predominantly published in this format for several reasons:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Self-describing**: A netCDF file includes both the data and metadata, which is information about the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Portable and sharable**: A netCDF file can be accessed by various types of computers and can be read and written simultaneously.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Scalable and appendable**: Data subsets can be easily extracted from netCDF files. Additional data can also be appended to an existing file, as long as the structure of both datasets is aligned.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Suitable for data archiving**: Older versions of netCDF data are as well supported as current and future versions by most softwares.\n",
    "\n",
    "Despite its widespread use, interpreting a netCDF file can be challenging, especially for newcomers to the format. This chapter will help you to easily understand the content structure of a standard netCDF file."

    "## NetCDF Content Structure\n",
    "\n",
    "A netCDF file generally contains **data** and attributes about the data, known as **metadata**. The data is composed of *dimensions* and *variables*, which include coordinate variables, data variables, and sometimes other types of variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "* *Dimensions* define how the data is organized.\n",
    "\n",
    "* *Coordinate variables*  specify the coordinates along each dimension.\n",
    "    \n",
    "* *Data variables* usually represent physical variables in the earth system science (ESS) domain, such as air temperature, wind speed, etc. These variables typically span multiple dimensions, usually over longitude, latitude, time, and vertical dimensions like altitude, depth, and pressure levels.\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition to the data, a standardized netCDF file includes two types of metadata:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. *Variable attributes*: These provide information about individual coordinate and data variables.\n",
    "    \n",
    "2. *Global attributes*: These provide information about the entire dataset."
