# Welcome to the Course!

Our course is about creating publishable netCDF files.

NetCDF is one of the most widely used scientific data formats in the earth system science (ESS). For scientists or anybody who want to publish their research data in netCDF format and make their datasets more interoperable and reusable, this course is worth going through.

In this course, we will introduce a widely adopted metadata standard, the CF Conventions, that provides guidelines and recommendations on constructing standard netCDF files from variable data. It was our goal to equip you with the ability to use the CF Conventions as a tool on your own when creating netCDF files. Thus, we prepared rich examples and hands-on exercises along with the theory. After this course, we believe that you will be able to interpret the CF Conventions' documentation, as well as build your first CF compliant netCDF file. Although not every aspect of the metadata standard was covered in this course, you can usually find answers to your questions in the [documentation](https://cfconventions.org/Data/cf-conventions/cf-conventions-1.11/cf-conventions.html) of the CF Conventions.
