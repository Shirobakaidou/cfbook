This tutorial is composed of the following chapters:

1. [An Introduction to netCDF](book/PART1_Intro_netCDF.ipynb)

2. [An Introduction to the CF Conventions](book/PART2_Introduction_CF_Conventions.ipynb)

3. [Create netCDF for gridded data with Xarray](book/PART3_Grid_netCDF_Xarray.ipynb): This chapter contains a brief introduction to the syntax of the `xarray` package. Please have a look here if you have difficulties understanding the code in other chapters.
