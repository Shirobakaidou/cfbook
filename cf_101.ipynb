    "In this chapter, we are going to learn about the CF Conventions, a widely adopted metadata standard for netCDF files. The question that rises at the first place would probably be why we want to standardize metadata? What's the benefit of putting effort in making the metadata conforming to a kind of standard before publishing a dataset? \n",
    "\n",
    "In a brief answer, becasue metadata standardization conforms to the FAIR principles, which are guidelines to make data more useful and valuable to the scientific community and other users. FAIR stands for:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Findable**: Data should be easy to find for both *humans* and *computers*. This means data should have a unique identifier and be described with rich metadata.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Accessible**: Once found, data should be easy to access, ideally through standardized methods. Even if the data is private, the metadata should be accessible to show the data exists.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Interoperable**: Data should be compatible with other data and tools. This means deploying data analysis workflows with different data and tools intergrated is much easier.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Reusable**: Data should be well-described and documented so it can be reused in the future. This involves clear usage licenses and detailed information about the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In a broader concept, standardized metadata will facilitate the achievement of FAIR principle. In the current age, scientific communities are generating, exchanging, and consuming huge amount of data. Assuming we are about to practice a new research, it's very likely that we need to ask ourselves the folloing quesitons: \n",
    "\n",
    "* it is challenging to find out whether there are valuable datasets available for my research? How can I find them, and very importantly, how can I access to them? \n",
    "\n",
    "* Are they in a ready-to-use status, or do I need to do extra tidy-up to make them usable for me? \n",
    "    \n",
    "Given the design of many modern data infrastructure, datasets with standard conforming metadata are more prone to be found (findable), and ease the joint use with other datasets (interoperable).\n",
    "Standardizing metadata will make a netCDF dataset more findable on the web, and ease the joint use with other data, ggf. across different tools (e.g. open source tools like cdf, nco, and licensed tools like Matlab, IDL and so on), and enhance its reusability for various purposes.\n",
    "\n",
    "On the other hand, if we were a data provider, standardizing metadata makes our published datasets more likely to be found, and it's easier for ourselves to manage the huge amount of data in our data infrastructure. Therefore, standardizing metadata becomes a highly recommended practice before publishing any kind of data.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the context of netCDF data publication in the ESS field, the CF Conventions is becoming a widely adopted metadata standard."

    "We are introducing the CF Conventions as if we're delving into it for the first time. But the truth is, we already encountered it, just in the previouss chapter. cus the CF Conventions provide definitions to different variable types (coordinate variable, auxiliary coordinate variable, boundary variable etc.), give guidlines on the content structure of different types of data in netCDF (grid, point, time series, trajectory, profiles), and standardizes what metadata should be offered and the annotation of the metadata.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the previous chapter, we learned about netCDF, a widely used data format in the earth system science, and its core centent structure. It is clear that metadata is an essential component for a netCDF file to be self-described. Beyond that, we also want to make the metadata comply with some standard because it makes scientific datasets more findable, accessible, interoperable, and reusable (the FAIR principle). In this chapter, we are going to learn about a widely implemented metadata standard for netCDF data format, the **Climate Forecast Conventions (CF Conventions)**.\n",
    "\n",
    "In general, metadata standards regulate what kind of attributes should be added for the data variables and the datasets, and standardize the annotation of the attributes. At first, let's make it clear that the CF Conventions is not the only metadata standard for netCDF files. Its accessor, the COARDS Conventions, is for example a widely implemented metadata standard too. Sometimes big data providers also have their own metadata standards. However, the CF Conventions is becoming more and more popular in the community by showing its good flexibility and compatibility with other standards. For instance, the COARDS Conventions places rigid restriction on the order of dimensions while the CF Conventions doesn't. And as a successor of the COARDS Conventions, the CF Conventions is *backward compatible* with COARDS, which means programs that can process CF conforming datasets should likely be able to process COARDS conforming datasets too.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now let's take a closer look at how the CF Conventions formulates the metadata in a netCDF file with an example [dataset](https://www.unidata.ucar.edu/software/netcdf/examples/tos_O1_2001-2002.nc) that contains sea surface temperatures collected by [PCMDI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Program_for_Climate_Model_Diagnosis_and_Intercomparison)."

    "For all kinds of variables, the attribute `units` and at least one of the attribute `long_name` and `standard_name` are required. Both `long_name` and `standard_name` tell what the variable is; `standard_name` must be a controlled vocabulary as defined in the [\"CF Standard Name Table\"](https://cfconventions.org/Data/cf-standard-names/current/build/cf-standard-name-table.html), while `long_name` allows data providers to compose a definition. If a variable has a `standard_name`, its `units` can be looked up in the \"CF Standard Name Table\" as well. In case it cannot be defined using the term available in the \"CF Standard Name Table\", data providers should define it under `long_name` and provide a `units` that's parsable by the UDUNITS library.\n",
    "\n",
    "As you can see, the example dataset contains three coordinate variables: `lon`, `lat`, and `time`. As regulated in the CF Conventions, a variable representing the longitude must literally have \"longitude\" as `standard_name` and \"degrees_east\" as `units`; similarly, the `standard_name` and `units` for a latitude variable must be \"latitude\" and \"degrees_north\". As for the time variable, it must have \"time\" as `standard_name` and a string similar to the form of \"[time-interval] since YYYY-MM-DD hh:mm:ss\" as `units`, e.g. in our example the unit of the time variable is `seconds since 2001-1-1`. \"seconds\", \"minutes\", \"hours\", and \"days\" are the most commonly used time intervals; it is not recommended to use \"months\" or \"years\" as the length of these time intervals can vary. If you aren't yet familiar with \"coordinate variable\" in a netCDF file, you can learn about it in the [previous chapter](netcdf_101.ipynb).\n",
